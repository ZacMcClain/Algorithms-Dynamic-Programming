\section{Problem}
\paragraph{}
Given $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ TB of available data for the next $n$ days and given the amount of data a server can process $s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n$ for $n$ days after a fresh reboot.
\paragraph{}
Choose the days on which you are going to reboot so as to maximize the total amount of data you process.
\section{Dynamic Programming Algorithm}
\subsection{Main Idea}
On each day, decide whether the server processing is limited by the available data or the processing capability.
\paragraph{Breaking Problem Into Sub-problems}
On day $d$, choose to reboot on day $i$ where $i$ is the index of the day that maximizes the amount of data processed in the right partition of the list.
