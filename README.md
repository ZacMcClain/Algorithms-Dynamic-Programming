##Source file(s):
	src/main.cpp

##Description:
	

##Usage:
	~/path/to/main.cpp $ ./dymProg ../inputs/ex1.txt

##Build Instructions:
	~/path/to/workingDir $ make

##Files:
Files must observe the fallowing format: Comments are denoted by a '%' symbol
at the beginning of a line. Full line comments only, Comments are contiguous and only
found at the beginning of the program. The first data line will always contain the
number of data entries in the file. All subsequent lines will be interpreted as data.

##Notes:
###Bugs:
There is a small chance that your terminal does not support ANSI codes, then
you will only see gibberish instead of output text.

###Implementation Details:
Please see in the comments in my source code for more details.
